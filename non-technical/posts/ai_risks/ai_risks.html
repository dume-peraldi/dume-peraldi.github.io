            I don't think AI will take over the world in the ways we expect, such as becoming sentient and intently carrying out malicious acts. These are scenarios that we can very much imagine and organizations are readily setting up AI Safety teams to prevent such cases of misalignment.

But when it comes to solving difficult problems, the time we take thinking deeply about how to solve the problem is as important as getting the answer right. And this process is taken away from us when we overuse LLMs in our lives.
            <br><br>
            For example, let's look at this question.
